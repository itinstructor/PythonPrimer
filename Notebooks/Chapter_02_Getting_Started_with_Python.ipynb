        "# The Concept of Type\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strongly Typed Languages\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the main differences between Python and programming languages\n",
        "such as Java and C++ is the concept of type.\n",
        "\n",
        "In strongly typed languages like Java and C++, variables not only have a\n",
        "name, they also have a type. The type determines the kind of data that\n",
        "you can store in the pigeonhole.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is probably more correct to say that the type determines the values\n",
        "that you can store there and the operations (addition, subtraction,\n",
        "etc.) that you can perform on those values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Python is Not Strongly Typed\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the characteristics that makes Python easier to use than Java is\n",
        "the fact that with Python you don't have to be concerned about the type\n",
        "of a variable. Python takes care of type issues for you behind the\n",
        "scenes. That ease of use comes with some costs attached.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Declaration of Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "Another difference between Python and Java is that with Java, you must\n",
        "declare variables before you can use them. Declaration of variables is\n",
        "not required with Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "With Python, if you need a variable, you simply come up with a name and\n",
        "start using it as a variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dangerous Curves Ahead!\n",
        "\n",
        "With this convenience comes some danger. You can only have one variable\n",
        "with the same name within the same scope (More on scope later).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Don't Use the Same Name for Two Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "With Python, if you unintentionally use the same name for two or more\n",
        "variables, the first will be overwritten by the second. This can lead to\n",
        "program bugs that are difficult to find and fix.\n",
        "\n",
        "### A More Subtle Danger\n",
        "\n",
        "A more subtle danger is that you create a variable that you intend to\n",
        "use more than once and you spell it incorrectly in one of those uses.\n",
